## Quicklinks

The quick answer is to use the
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/discussions/).

## Pre-checklist

Before asking a question:

- read carefully the VS Code xPack [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/vscode/)
- check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/faq/)
- check the GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/discussions/)
- check the
GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find an answer, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/discussions/).

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug in **ilg-vscode.xpack**
extension
(if you have doubts, use the discussions),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance **ilg-vscode.xpack**,
register a **New Issue** in the the
GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/issues/)
tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the discussions**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/discussions/)**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
