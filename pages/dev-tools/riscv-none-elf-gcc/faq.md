{% capture question_1 %}
There are two RISC-V toolchains, `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` and
`riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` (or `riscv64-none-elf-gcc` and
`riscv32-none-elf-gcc`); you have only one. How can you generate
32 and 64-bit code?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture answer_1 %}
All RISC-V GCC toolchains, if built correctly, are able to generate
both 32/64-bit code, based on `-march` and `-mabi`. Thus a single
version is enough for all use cases.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture question_3 %}
Why `riscv-none-elf-gcc` and not `riscv-none-eabi-gcc`, as Arm uses?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture answer_3 %}
For the moment RISC-V does not define an EABI (Embedded ABI) and uses the
same Unix ABI for embedded applications too, thus `-eabi-` would not be
accurate.
