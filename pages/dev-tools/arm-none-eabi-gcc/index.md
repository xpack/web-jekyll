## Overview

The **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC**
is an alternate binary distribution that complements the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
maintained by Arm.

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure,
  the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (Intel Windows 64-bit, Intel GNU/Linux 64-bit, Arm GNU/Linux
  64/32-bit, Intel macOS 64-bit, Apple Silicon macOS 64-bit)
- a convenient integration with Continuous Integration environments,
  like GitHub Actions
- a better integration with development environments
  like **Eclipse Embedded CDT**.

All binaries are self-contained, they include all required libraries,
and can be installed in any location.

## Compatibility

The **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** is fully compatible with the
original GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain distribution by Arm.

Occasionally, when bugs are discovered and the yearly Arm release schedule
would add unacceptably long delays, the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC**
moves ahead of Arm and uses more recent tools versions that fix the bugs.

## Install

The details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on various
platforms are presented in the separate
[install]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/install/) page.

## Documentation

To save space and bandwidth, the original GNU GCC documentation is available
[online](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/).

## Support

For the various support options, please read the separate
[support]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/support/) page.

In early releases, Python support in `gdb` was tricky and required
the same versions of
[Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/python/) to be installed.

## Change log

The release and change log is available in the repository
[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/CHANGELOG.md) file.
