## Why QEMU?

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) is the long-standing open-source
cross-platform emulator. It is mature, it provides a good framework
for emulation, it implements a GDB server, it provides support for
semihosting, and although it does not intend to accurately simulate
processor time behaviour, it does keep a quite accurate track of
time when emulating timer interrupts, so it can also be used to
emulate applications using RTOS-es.

## Overview

**xPack QEMU RISC-V** is a cross-platform binary distribution of
the public open-source
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) project.

## Benefits

The main benefits of using the **xPack QEMU RISC-V** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure,
  the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (Intel Windows 64-bit, Intel GNU/Linux 64-bit, Arm GNU/Linux
  64/32-bit, Intel macOS 64-bit, Apple Silicon macOS 64-bit)
- a better integration with development environments
  like **Eclipse Embedded CDT**;
  users can run the _Hello World_ projects generated by the
  Eclipse templates immediately, without any specific hardware,
  neither development board nor JTAG programmer; all debugging
  features, like single stepping, inspecting variables, registers,
  etc. are supported
- a convenient integration with Continuous Integration environments,
  like GitHub Actions; the emulator provides a very convenient platform for running
  **unit tests**, fully supporting the **semihosting** features
  required for this.

All binaries are self-contained, they include all required libraries,
and can be installed in any location.

### Compatibility & peripherals

The xPack QEMU RISC-V is fully compatible with the original
`qemu-system-riscv32` and `qemu-system-riscv64`.

**xPack QEMU RISC-V** is generally intended for running tests, mainly
**unit tests**.

## Semihosting and ITM

The recommended method to display messages from the target is via
semihosting.

## Documentation

The official QEMU documentation is available
[online](http://wiki.qemu.org/Manual).

## Install

The details of installing the **xPack QEMU RISC-V** on various platforms are
presented in a dedicated
[install]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-riscv/install) page.

## Testing

The recommended method to test QEMU is using the new Eclipse QEMU RISC-V Debugging
plug-in; create a test project using the _Hello World_ project template.

## Support

For the various support options, please read the separate
[support]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-riscv/support/) page.

## Change log

The release and change log is available in the repository
[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv-xpack/blob/xpack/CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Build details

For those interested on the procedure used to build these packages,
please read the
[How to build](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv-xpack/blob/xpack/README-BUILD.md)
