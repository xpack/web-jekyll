## Quicklinks

- GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/)
- [xPack chatroom](https://gitter.im/xpack/) - a place for users to chat

## Check the documentation

The xPack OpenOCD provides the original documentation in the
installed folders:

- `share/doc/pdf/openocd.pdf`

## Use the OpenOCD support channels

The xPack OpenOCD is only a binary distribution of the standard source code
OpenOCD, and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing
problems.

If you have problems related to the current OpenOCD functionality, please
use the official OpenOCD [support channels](https://openocd.org/pages/discussion.html).

## Check the FAQ

Check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/openocd/faq/)
for similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Discussions

Check the GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/) for
similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Issues

Check the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/),
and enter a **New discussion** in the **Q&A** category.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary
distribution, not OpenOCD itself (if you have doubts, use the GitHub Discussions),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the **xPack OpenOCD**
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/)
tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the GitHub Discussions**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/)**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
