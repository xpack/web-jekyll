## Check the documentation

The GNU Make manual is available from:

- [https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)

## Use the Windows Build Tools support channels

The xPack Windows Build Tools is only a binary distribution of
the standard source code
GNU Make, and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing
problems.

If you have problems related to the current GNU Make functionality, please
use the official [support channels](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/).

## Check the FAQ

GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/issues/)

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/discussions/),
and enter a **New discussion**.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary
distribution, not GNU Make itself (if you have doubts, use the GitHub Discussions),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the **xPack Windows Build Tools**
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the the
GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/issues/)
tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the GitHub Discussions**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/discussions/)**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
