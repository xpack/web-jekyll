## Check the documentation

The GNU Make manual is available from:

- [https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)

## Use the Windows Build Tools support channels

The xPack Windows Build Tools is only a binary distribution of
the standard source code
GNU Make, and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing
problems.

If you have problems related to the current GNU Make functionality, please
use the official [support channels](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/).

## Check the FAQ

Check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/windows-build-tools/faq/)
for similar problems.

## Check the xPack forums

Check the [xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for
similar problems.

## Check the GitHub issues

Check the
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[xPack forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/),
and enter a **New Topic** in the Windows Build Tools section.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary
distribution, not GNU Make itself (if you have doubts, use the forum),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the **xPack Windows Build Tools**
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the the
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/issues/)
tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the forums**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the xPack forums**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since forum posts are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
