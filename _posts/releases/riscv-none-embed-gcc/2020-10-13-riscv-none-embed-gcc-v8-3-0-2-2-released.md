is the **xPack** distribution of the
[SiFive RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (Intel 32/64-bit),
**macOS** (Intel 64-bit) and **GNU/Linux** (Intel 32/64-bit, Arm 32/64-bit).

{% include note.html content="The main target for the Arm binaries
are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices." %}

## Download

The binary files are available from [GitHub Releases]({{ page.download_url }}).

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on
various platforms are presented in the separate
[Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/riscv-none-embed-gcc/install/) page.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC is with
[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

To install the latest version available, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }}
```

## Compliance

Starting with 8.2.0-2, the xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC (formerly
GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V GCC) follows
the official [SiFive releases](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases),
with as little differences as possible.

This release is based on the
[v2020.04.0-Toolchain.Only](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases/tag/v2020.04.0-Toolchain.Only)
release, and includes the SiFive extensions.

## Changes

### Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments

### newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

### nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

### Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

{% include important.html content="It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail." %}

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python 3.7**.

Mode details on the prerequisites of running GDB with Python support are
available from
[GDB with Python support](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/python/).

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

{% include note.html content="TUI is not available on Windows." %}

## Bug fixes

- binutils 2.32 introduced a regression bug
[24289](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24289) which
prevented MEMORY regions to use LENGTH and ORIGIN. The bug was fixed in
binutils 2.33.1 via commit
[912ebfa](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=912ebfa0d748b4a762dbc4311364c38692c7f626). In this release, on top
of the SiFive sources, this commit was applied via git cherry pick,
and LENGTH and ORIGIN are now recognised as expected.

## Known problems

- the GDB binary with Python support was built with version 3.7,
  and require exactly this version in order to run properly;
- the archive size got too big for the Windows 32-bit node to handle, and
  `xpm install` fails with _RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed_.

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally in the
same folder as the executable.

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep runpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library rpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, used `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and does not tolerate setting
it in the environment.

### `@executable_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the dynamic libraries are adjusted with `otool` to use a
relative path.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- Intel GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- Arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[How to build](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-BUILD.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start and compile several simple
programs on a wide range of platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack RISC-V Embed GCC on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/735326282)
- [test xPack RISC-V Embed GCC on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/735326376)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.14.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.
