For your convenience, the [Windows Build Tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/windows-build-tools/) were repacked as a Windows setup.

[Binary files »]({{ page.download_url }})

![Build Tools setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/win-build-tools-setup.png)

Please note that the setup does not install any components outside the selected destination folder, and also includes an uninstall program, to completely remove the tools from the system.

The repacking also corrected a problem with the previous archive (the missing DLLs were added), so the previous archive (Cross Build Tools.zip) is now considered DEPRECATED.

For more information, please read the [dedicated page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/windows-build-tools/).

## Download

The binary files are available from [GitHub Releases]({{ page.download_url }}).

The available files are:

- `Build-Tools-w32-20141202154847-setup.exe`
- `Cross.Build.Tools.zip`

**Cross Build Tools.zip** is included for archiving purposes and is now considered DEPRECATED.
